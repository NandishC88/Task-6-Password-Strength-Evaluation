🔐 Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
🎯 Objective:

To understand what makes a password strong and evaluate its effectiveness using online password strength testing tools.

🧰 Tools Used:

Online Password Strength Checker: passwordmeter.com

Web Browser: For testing and recording results

🧭 Procedure:

Created multiple passwords with different levels of complexity.

Included variations in uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length.

Tested each password using the Password Meter online tool.

Observed and noted down the score and feedback provided.

Compared results to identify what factors make passwords stronger.

Researched password attack methods (like brute force and dictionary attacks).

Summarized key best practices for password creation and security.

📊 Results:
Password	Strength Score	Tool Feedback
apple123	25% (Weak)	Too short, lacks symbols and uppercase letters.
Apple@123	55% (Moderate)	Better with symbols and mix of cases, but still predictable.
ApPlE@#2024!	80% (Strong)	Excellent variation of characters and good length.
A$pL3!eX@9876_#	100% (Very Strong)	Long, random, and highly secure against attacks.
💡 Analysis:

Passwords with longer length, mixed character types, and unpredictable patterns receive higher scores.

Simple passwords are easy to guess or crack through brute-force and dictionary attacks.

Complex passwords greatly increase protection by multiplying possible combinations.

🧠 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:

Use 12–16 characters minimum.

Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.

Avoid using names, birthdates, or common words.

Do not reuse the same password across multiple websites.

Use a password manager to safely store complex passwords.

Periodically update passwords for critical accounts.

⚔️ Common Password Attack Types:

Brute Force Attack: Tries every possible combination; longer passwords take much longer to break.

Dictionary Attack: Uses lists of common passwords or words; adding symbols and random elements prevents this.

🧾 Conclusion:

Password strength depends on length, randomness, and complexity.
Testing with tools like PasswordMeter provides valuable feedback to improve password security.
Following best practices ensures better protection against online threats and hacking attempts.

🏁 Outcome:

Gained a clear understanding of password security principles, evaluated password strengths effectively, and learned how to create robust, secure passwords for digital safety.
